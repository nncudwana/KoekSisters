    <h1>Yummy Koeksisters</h1>
    <p>
      A koeksister is a traditional Afrikaner confectionery made of fried dough
      infused in syrup or honey. There is also a Cape Malay version of the
      dish,which is a fried ball of dough that is rolled in desiccated coconut
      called a koesister. The name derives from the Dutch word "koek", which
      generally means a wheat flour confectionery. Koeksisters are prepared by
      frying plaited dough strips in oil, then submersing the hot fried dough
      into ice cold sugar syrup. Koeksisters have a golden crunchy crust and
      liquid syrup centre, are very sticky and sweet, and taste like honey.
